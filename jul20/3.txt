## we need to print i hate you when we match uri as iloveyou
## for this we have to include extra location in server
## as we need ot to change direct nginx.conf file
## we also can in sites-available/default 
## which is include in nginx.conf

location = /iloveyou  {
    default_type text/html;
    return 200 "I HATE YOUUUU";
}

## we have included this in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

## whenever we type http://localhost:80
 ## we get normal nginx page

 ## whenever we type http://localhost:80/iloveyou
## we can see I HATE YOUUUU
